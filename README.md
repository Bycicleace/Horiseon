# Horiseon Code Refactoring

## Project Details
The goal of this project is to refactor the current webpage so that semantic elements are used, CSS styles are fixed and condensed as needed, code is cleaned up, and eny errors are fixed. The specific story and acceptance criteria are as follows:

### User Story
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a webpage meets accessibility standards
- When I view the source code, then I find semantic HTML elements
- When I view the structure of the HTML elements, then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- When I view the image elements, then I find accessible alt attributes
- When I view the heading attributes, then they fall in sequential order
- When I view the title element, then I find a concise, descriptive title

## Rough Code Changes
- Fixed broken link to SEO section
- Added some spacing to the HTML for easier section breaks
- Changed the Title of the website
- Condensed CSS and removed unneeded classes
- Added comments to the CSS file.
